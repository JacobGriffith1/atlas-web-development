        <p>
            Hi! My name is Jacob Griffith. I'm a student at Atlas School, specializing in Full-Stack Web Development.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm attending Atlas with the intent to learn the necessary skills to design and maintain websites professionally. Too often have I seen businesses with lackluster, difficult to use, functionally broken websites. My goal is to solve that problem! I am hoping to offer freelance web-design services in the near future, hopefully accquiring enough meaningful experience to be picked up by a company for more consistent income.
        </p>

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>I love music, and will not hesitate to sing along with a song I like! I love hearing and learning new songs, so please share any that you like. I can't guarantee that I'll like everything I hear, but I'm always interested in what other people listen to. Chances are, if I like a song, I'll learn the lyrics.</li>
                <li>I briefly ran games of Pathfinder RPG professionally! Of course, COVID-19 ruined that gig, but it was cool while it lasted. I still love to play and run TTRPGs, and I'm currently working on designing a setting for future campaigns I want to run.</li>
                <li>I have a vast adoration for Lego's BIONICLE line of products, and I build customs from time to time with the same parts I grew up playing with.</li>
                <li>Presently occupying my desire to build things, model kits have become a favorite of mine. I especially enjoy Bandai's Gundam plastic model kits (Gunpla) and Kotobukiya's ZOIDS plastic model kits.</li>
            </ul>
